# Split Ruby SDK
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/splitio/ruby-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/splitio/ruby-client)

## Overview
This SDK is designed to work with [Split](https://www.split.io), the platform for controlled rollouts, serving features to your users via the Split feature flag to manage your complete customer experience.

## Compatibility
The Ruby SDK support Ruby version 2.3.0 or later and JRuby or 9.1.17 o later.

Also the Ruby SDK has been tested as a standalone app as well as using the following web servers:
 - Puma
 - Passenger
 - Unicorn

For other setups, please reach out to [support@split.io](mailto:support@split.io).

## Development
### Building the SDK
To install this gem dependencies onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

### Benchmarks
To benchmark the hashing algorithms (MurmurHash) run:

```bash
bundle exec rake compile:murmurhash
```

### Running tests
The gem uses `rspec` for unit testing. You can find the files for the unit tests and the specs helper file (`spec_helper.rb`) under the default `/spec` folder.

To run all the specs in the `spec` folder, use the provided rake task (_make sure Redis is running in localhost_):

```bash
  bundle exec rspec
```

`Simplecov` is used for coverage reporting. Upon executing the rake task it will store the reports in the `/coverage` folder.
